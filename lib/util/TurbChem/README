This directory assists in the post-processing of HDF5 files generated on the Chombo framework. It provides a means by which extra variables are computed from existing data. The intent is to be compatible with

  (1) HDF5 files with multiple levels of AMR
  (2) mapped domains
  (3) periodic and bounded domains
  (4) up to 6th order accuracy of computed quantities

It would be nice to easily be able to use/compute

  (a) typical derivative-based operations (gradient, divergence, curl)
  (b) tensor operations (inner product, outer product, etc.)
  (c) specialized quantities (entropy, rms values, stress tensor, etc.)
  (d) spatially dependent quantities (x+, y+, z+, etc.)
  (e) temporally dependent quantities (time-derivatives, dissipation rate, etc.)

The setup is also intended to provide the capability to
  (i)  analyze multiple HDF5 files from the same simulation and
  (ii) output domain-wide sums or single-point data as a time series (csv file output).
